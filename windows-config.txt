Configure the Windows Server to Use the Squid Proxy

Connect to the Windows Server:

Use RDP to connect to the Windows Server via a bastion host or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, as it’s in a private subnet.

Configure System-Wide Proxy:

Open Control Panel > Network and Internet > Internet Options.
Go to the Connections tab and click LAN settings.
Check Use a proxy server for your LAN.

Enter the Squid proxy’s private IP (e.g., 10.0.1.100) and port (3128) in the Address and Port fields.

Click OK and Apply.
---------------------

Test Proxy Connectivity:

Open a Command Prompt and test with curl:

curl -x http://10.0.1.100:3128 https://www.google.com

If successful, you should see HTML output. Test a non-whitelisted domain (e.g., http://example.com) to confirm it’s blocked (should return a 403 error).

Open a web browser and try accessing https://www.google.com (should work) and http://example.com (should be blocked).
