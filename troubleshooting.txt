Step 5: Troubleshooting

403 Forbidden Errors:

Verify the domain is in /etc/squid/whitelist.txt (use a leading dot for subdomains, e.g., .google.com).

Check ACLs in squid.conf to ensure the Windows Server’s IP is in localnet.
Confirm the whitelist.txt file path and permissions.


Connection Issues:

Ensure the Squid proxy’s private IP and port (3128) are correctly set in the Windows Server’s proxy settings.

Verify security group rules allow TCP 3128 from the private subnet to the Squid instance.


Transaction Errors:

If error:transaction-end-before-headers appears in logs, check network connectivity (ping 10.0.1.100 from the Windows Server) and increase timeouts in squid.conf:

request_timeout 30 seconds
connect_timeout 10 seconds


Testing:

Use curl from the Windows Server to diagnose:

curl -x http://10.0.1.100:3128 https://www.google.com


Post-Deployment Maintenance:

Update Whitelist:

Edit /etc/squid/whitelist.txt to add/remove domains and reload Squid:

sudo squid -k reconfigure


Monitor Performance:

Use tools like sarg to generate reports on Squid usage:

sudo apt install -y sarg
sarg -x


Backup Configurations:

Regularly back up /etc/squid/squid.conf and /etc/squid/whitelist.txt:

sudo cp /etc/squid/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf.bak
sudo cp /etc/squid/whitelist.txt /etc/squid/whitelist.txt.bak
